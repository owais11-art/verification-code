# Verification-code component

It is one of the challanges from Advent of JavaScript in which we have to build a verification code component.

# How to Run

- install vite.
- Clone this repository (git clone https://github.com/owais11-art/verification-code.git).
- npm install (To install all the dependencies)
- npm run dev (To start development server at http://localhost:5173/)

# Functionality

- Users can enter 4-digit verification code.
- Leaving any input box empty or entering text instead of digit will give error.
- On validating code it will show verified message.
- On entering value in input box focus automatically moves to next input box.
